## üìå **1. Detailed Technical Overview for Each Stage**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Stage 1: New Financial Events Data Scraping**

**Sources to Scrape:**

| Tier | Type | Sources/Examples | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------------------|------|------|
| **Tier 1** | Financial Filings & Reports | SEC (EDGAR), Earnings Calls (Seeking Alpha, FactSet, AlphaSense), Federal Reserve Statements | Structured, authoritative data, highest reliability | Parsing complexity, rate limits |
| **Tier 2** | Reputable News Sources¬†|¬†Reuters,¬†Bloomberg, CNBC, MarketWatch, newsdigest.ai¬†| Relatively structured, often high accuracy and timely | Paywalls, scraping restrictions |
| **Tier 3** | Social & Alternative data¬†| Reddit (e.g. r/WallStreetBets), Twitter/X, Stocktwits | Leading indicators, sentiment signals | Noise-heavy, lower accuracy |

**Scraping Methods and Recommendations**:

- **Option 1: Deterministic Scraping**
  - **Recommendation:** Good for Tier 1 (SEC), feasible & straightforward (requests, Beautiful Soup, Selenium if JS needed, Scrapy).
  - **Pros:** Low-cost, reliable, fast, controllable.
  - **Cons:** Limited for nuanced event detection.

- **Option 2: LLM-assisted Scraping (Deep scrapers using GPT-4 API)**
  - **Recommendation:** Excellent for extracting complex scenarios, parsing tone, inferring significance from unstructured news articles ([openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8868588-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-and-semantic-search-for-gpts)).
  - **Current Best Models (As of March 2025):**
    - GPT-4 Turbo API (OpenAI)
    - Claude 3 API (Anthropic)

  - **Pros:** High accuracy on nuanced events, sophisticated interpretation.
  - **Cons:** API cost, higher complexity of setup.

---

## üß† **Stage 2: Fine-Tuned Event Classifier**

- **Models & Libraries**:
  - Hugging Face Transformers (DeBERTa-v3, FinBERT)
  - spaCy (NER tagging, entity recognition)

- **Classifier Model Choices (2025 Recommended)**:
  - DeBERTa-v3 (robust, accurate for sequence classification tasks)
  - Financial-specific models: FinBERT, BloombergGPT (expensive but specialized)

- **Pros:** Customizable, interpretable, scalable with ONNX/Quantization.
- **Cons:** Data-intensive (needs labeling/fine-tuning).

---

## üìñ **Stage 3: RAG Retrieval**

**Knowledge Database Composition**:

- **Historical Events and Market Responses**
  - Previous rate hikes, tariff announcements, financial crises outcomes
- **Institutional Report Summaries**
  - Analyst comments (e.g., Goldman, Morgan Stanley summaries)
- **Economic History Data**
  - Macro-economic indicators from IMF, Fed, World Bank.

**Embedding Models/Algorithms**:

- OpenAI Embeddings (`text-embedding-ada-002` / `text-embedding-3-small` latest as of Mar 2025)
- Sentence Transformers (e.g. all-MiniLM-L6-v2) - cost-effective, fast, robust

*Retrieval stack:*
- Database: Pinecone (ease of use & managed service), FAISS (open source, customizable), Qdrant.
- Pros (Pinecone): Quick setup, cloud-managed.
- Con: Cost at scale (managed service fees).

---

## üîé **Stage 4: Large Language Model Reasoning & Analysis**

- **Best models available as of 2025**:
  - **GPT-4 Turbo API** (OpenAI)
  - **Claude 3 API** (Anthropic) ([anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval))
- **Recommendation**: Using large language model via API due to superior reasoning.

**Pros:**
- Excellent logical reasoning, chaining, scenario generation.

**Cons:**
- API costs per token consumed.

---

## üìê **Stage 5: Small Fine-Tuned Formatter Model**

- **Fine-Tuning Options (2025 best options)**:
  - Mistral-Mini, Phi-3-mini, TinyLlama (small, efficient)
- **Libraries:** Hugging Face PEFT/LoRA, QLoRA.

**Why smaller formatter:** cost-effective, fast, reproducible, customizable styling.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **Stage 6: Structured Output Generation Formats**

- Use JSON for structured API & internal pipeline.
- YAML suitable for config, metadata, pipeline orchestration.

---

## üß™ **Stage 7: Testing & Best Practices**

- **CI/CD & MLOps Pipeline**:
  - Github Actions, GitLab CI, MLflow, DVC (ML versioning)

- **Unit & Integration Testing**
  - pytest (unit tests for API/backends)
  - Great Expectations, Pandera (data quality tests)

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Classification tasks: F1, Accuracy, Precision, Recall
  - Generative outputs: BLEU, ROUGE, GPT eval scores via GPTEval
  - Semantic similarity: Cosine similarity on embeddings

- **GitHub**: Critical for version control, reproducibility.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è¬†**General Tips & Fundamental Considerations**

- **Separate RAG KB (historical data) from real-time events (new scraping)**.
  - Use deterministic scraping first, use separate embedding vector space for historical context ([wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation)).
- **Cost Optimization**:
  - Limit API usage via batching prompts, sequential Chains of Thought.
  - Caching frequent prompts (Anthropic prompt caching, reducing costs up to 90% ([anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval))).

## üìä **Final Output Examples (best 3)**:

```markdown
Event: OPEC announces production cuts (2024-02-20)

Analysis:
Mechanism: Oil supply reductions traditionally boost energy prices, feeding global inflation.

Historical Examples:
- 2022 OPEC cuts ‚Üí Brent crude rose by 20% in 3 months
- 1973 embargo ‚Üí Severe recession and market crash

Confidence: High. Strong correlation historically evident.

Counterarguments: Renewable energy transitions may dampen price spikes compared to historical impact.
```

```markdown
Event: SEC charges major bank with financial misconduct (2024-01-15)

Analysis:
Mechanism: Regulatory actions erode investor trust, trigger compliance costs, potential fines impacting profits.

Historical Examples:
- Wells Fargo scandal 2016 ‚Üí Stock fell 10%
- JPM London Whale 2012 ‚Üí Brief impact, fully recovered

Confidence: Medium. Severity dependent on settlement outcomes.

Counterarguments: Quick resolution or negligible fines may have minimal long-term impact.
```

```markdown
Event: Major Tech firm reports unexpected quarterly loss (2024-02-01)

Analysis:
Mechanism: Earnings surprises significantly downgrade investor confidence, triggering sell-offs, especially growth stocks.

Historical Examples:
- Meta Q4 2021 miss ‚Üí Stock fell 25% over one month
- Netflix subscriber miss April 2022 ‚Üí Fell 35% over three months

Confidence: High. Immediate negative market response historically strong.

Counterarguments: Potential aggressive cost-cutting measures or strategic pivots.
