# **Project 2: Financial Event Analysis & Institutional Narrative Generation**

---

## üéØ **Overview**
This project demonstrates end-to-end Machine Learning skills and NLP expertise by automating a realistic financial workflow:
- **Capturing structured financial news/events** from multiple reputable sources including financial filings (SEC EDGAR), regulatory announcements, earnings call transcripts, and credible news providers such as [newsdigest.ai](https://www.newsdigest.ai).
- **Classifying and contextually analyzing these events** using fine-tuned NLP models.
- **Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to generate succinct, structured analyst-style market impact narratives, similar in tone and format to top-tier institutional analyst reports.

The final outcome is a concise financial insights platform providing structured institutional-quality market analyses with explicit historical analogies, scenarios, confidence ratings, and nuanced counterarguments.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Workflow**

The project pipeline comprises five distinct ML-NLP components:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Financial Data Pipeline & Event Extraction**
- **Real-time data scraping**:
  - SEC filings (using `sec-edgar-downloader` Python package).
  - Earnings call transcripts (Seeking Alpha/Yahoo finance via Python Scrapy or BeautifulSoup).
  - Credible news providers ([newsdigest.ai](https://www.newsdigest.ai) via RSS/API integration and BeautifulSoup extraction).
- **Event detection pipeline**:
  - Advanced text preprocessing (spaCy NER, Regex extraction) to isolate events like `EARNINGS_WARNING`, `REGULATORY_CHANGE`, `RATE_DECISION`.
  - Final dataset schema:
    ```json
    {
      "event": "Tariff increase on imported steel",
      "date": "2024-03-01",
      "source": "newsdigest.ai",
      "company": ["Ford", "General Motors"],
      "sector": "Automotive, Industrials",
      "type": ["TARIFF", "MARGIN_COMPRESSION"]
    }
    ```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Financial-Specific Event Classifier**
- **Model**: Fine-tuned **DeBERTa-v3-base** (trained on ~5000 financial events).
- **Datasets leveraged**:
  - SEC EDGAR Corpus.
  - FiQA SA dataset (financial event sentiment).
  - News articles from credible financial news sources, classified and tagged manually for validation (~500 samples).
- **MLOps tech stack:** MLflow, ONNX conversion, automated model metrics & experiments.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **RAG Module: Historical Precedent Retrieval**
- **Knowledge Base**:
  - Curated dataset of past market-impact events (2000-present).
  - Analyst commentary from credible publicly available sources (market reports, Goldman Sachs & Morgan Stanley analyst report summaries).
- **Embeddings & indexing**: FAISS vector index with OpenAI or Sentence Transformers (`text-embedding-3-small`), metadata tags such as event type, sector, and timeframe for efficient retrieval.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Narrative Generation (Institutional Analyst Style)**
- **Generative Model**: Fine-tuned **Phi-3-mini quantized at 4-bit**.
- **Synthetic Dataset Creation**:
  - ~1000 carefully-crafted institutional-style synthetic reports generated via GPT-4, each report rigorously validated by grammar and style (Goldman/Morgan Stanley format examples).
  - Publicly released dataset for hiring managers' and recruiters' visibility on Hugging Face datasets repository.
- **Prompt Template for Generative Module**:
  ```bash
  Generate Analyst Report:
  [Event]: {event}
  [Affected Companies/Sector]: {company/sector}
  [Mechanism]: Clearly explain the cause-effect on the market.
  [Historical Examples]: Retrieve relevant historical events for analogy/comparison.
  [Market Confidence Rating]: High/Medium/Low (Provide rationales.)
  [Counterarguments/Alternatives]: Plausible counter-scenarios or mitigating factors. 
  ```

- **Example Generated Output**:
  ```markdown
  Mechanism: Tariffs on steel imports significantly raise input material costs for automakers, compressing automotive margins and profitability outlook.

  Historical context:
  - 2018 Trump steel tariffs ‚Üí Automotive sector dropped 9% over 1 month.
  - 2002 Bush steel tariffs ‚Üí U.S. Industrials sector fell approximately 15% over Q2.

  Confidence: Medium-high. Tariffs typically trigger short-term margin pressure; broader negative macroeconomic sentiment amplifies sell-off risks.

  Counterarguments: Potential Federal Reserve easing (rate cuts) to offset sector-wide impacts; possibility of tariff rollback on diplomatic negotiations.
  ```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualization and Deployment**
- **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)**:
  - Real-time display of incoming financial events.
  - Structured narrative generation preview (side-by-side with original news).
  - Historical reference link-backs and metadata visualization.
- **Production-Grade API (FastAPI & Docker)**:
  - RESTful API endpoints for narrative generation service.
  - Easy deployment: containerized setup & clean Dockerfile.

---

## üéì **Technical Skills Demonstrated & Valued by Hiring Managers**
- **NLP proficiency**: Fine-tuning transformers, RAG integration, textual analytic precision.
- **MLOps Best Practices**: Model quantization (4-bit optimization), experiment tracking, reproducibility via MLflow and Docker containers.
- **Real-world data management capability**: Handling and cleaning financial news sources, structured financial documents, EDGAR filings, and regulatory news.
- **Deployment Skillset**: Accessible APIs, containerization via Docker, intuitive UX through Streamlit for user-facing analytics.
