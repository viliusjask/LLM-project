Below is a rewritten version of Project 2—now dubbed “Financial Signal Synthesizer”—that emphasizes the full data engineering lifecycle, model fine‐tuning, and deployment best practices. It also integrates tier‐2 news sources (e.g., aggregated financial news) to enrich the context for event analyses. This version is designed to yield strong learning outcomes and attract hiring managers who value end‐to‐end ML/NLP system development.

1. Overview  
------------------------------------------------  
Objective: Build an end‐to‐end system that ingests diverse financial data—from primary sources like SEC filings and earnings transcripts to tier‐2 financial news—and outputs analyst‐style reports. These reports will blend automated event classification, historical precedent retrieval, and generative narrative synthesis that mirrors professional market insights.

Key Goals:
• Develop robust data pipelines that harmonize official datasets with real‑time market and news data.  
• Leverage modern NLP techniques (e.g., fine‑tuning transformer classifiers and retrieval‑augmented generation) to extract and contextualize market signals.  
• Implement best practices in code modularity, experiment tracking, and deployment (using Docker, FastAPI, and Streamlit).  
• Demonstrate clear learning outcomes in data engineering, model quantization/optimization, and MLOps.

2. Core Technical Components  
──────────────────────────────

2.1 Data Ingestion & Processing  
------------------------------------------------  
• Primary Sources:  
 – SEC EDGAR filings (10-K, 10-Q) using tools like the Python sec‑edgar‑downloader.  
 – Earnings calls transcripts scraped from sites like Yahoo Finance or Seeking Alpha.  
 – Central bank announcements (e.g., FOMC statements) via open APIs.

• Tier‑2 News & Sentiment:  
 – Ingest real‑time financial news through APIs and scraping of aggregators such as [newsdigest.ai](https://www.newsdigest.ai/) to capture breaking stories and market sentiment.  
 – Integrate curated articles (e.g., insights from [valueinvesting.substack.com](https://valueinvesting.substack.com/p/interestrate2024)) to provide broader macroeconomic context.

• Preprocessing:  
 – Clean and structure raw text from multiple sources using Pandas and spaCy; extract key sections (e.g., “Risk Factors”) and identify event triggers (e.g., tariff impositions, interest rate hikes).  
 – Use regular expressions and NER to tag events like EARNINGS_WARNING, CAPEX_INCREASE, or REGULATORY_RISK.

2.2 Event Classification & Model Training  
------------------------------------------------  
• Fine‑Tuned Transformer:  
 – Start with a base model such as DeBERTa‑v3 and fine‑tune on a curated dataset (~5,000 labeled examples) covering financial events.  
 – Train to reliably extract structured JSON outputs with fields like event type, affected sectors, and confidence scores.

• MLOps:  
 – Use MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning, and export optimized versions to ONNX for inference efficiency.  
 – Compare quantization strategies (e.g., 4‑bit vs. 8‑bit) to balance performance and cost.

2.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Historical Context  
------------------------------------------------  
• Historical Knowledge Base:  
 – Index a mixed database of historical financial events (e.g., past tariff shocks, recession warnings) and public equity research using vector embeddings (via text‑embedding‑3 or Sentence Transformers).  
 – Leverage FAISS for rapid metadata-filtered retrieval that grounds outputs in reality.

• Tier‑2 News Integration:  
 – Incorporate recent news snippets to provide additional context and cross-validation. For example, news signals about rising tariffs may be paired with historical data to refine confidence levels.

2.4 Narrative Report Generation  
------------------------------------------------  
• Fine‑Tuned Generation Model:  
 – Adapt a compact, quantized language model (e.g., a 4‑bit version of Phi‑3 or an equivalent) on a synthetic dataset generated via GPT‑4. The training data mimics institutional report formats (like those from GS/MS) and now also factors in tier‑2 news insights.

• Output Construction:  
 – The generative engine retrieves historical parallels via RAG, integrates event classifications from primary data, and supplements this with tier‑2 market sentiment.  
 – The final narrative is structured into sections: Mechanism, Historical Precedents, Confidence, and Counterarguments.

 Example Final Output:  
  "Mechanism: Tariffs raise input costs, squeezing margins for import-reliant sectors (autos, retail).  
   Historical:  
    2018 Trump tariffs → S&P dropped 6% in 2 weeks.  
    2002 Bush steel tariffs → industrials fell 15%.  
   Confidence: Medium (tariffs often overblown, but macro is fragile).  
   Counterarguments: Fed might cut rates to offset, or China delays retaliation."  

2.5 Visualization & API Deployment  
------------------------------------------------  
• Interactive Dashboard:  
 – Develop a Streamlit UI featuring a search interface to filter events by category, time, sector, and confidence score.  
 – Display side‑by‑side comparisons of generated narratives versus historical benchmarks.

• API Services:  
 – Implement a FastAPI endpoint to allow programmatic access to report generation capabilities.  
 – Dockerize the application for ease of deployment and reproducibility.
