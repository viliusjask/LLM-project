# **Project Requirements Document (PRD): Financial Event Intelligence System**

**Purpose**: Portfolio Showcase | **Target**: ML/AI Technical Hiring Teams

---

## **1. Project Vision**

Build an end-to-end financial intelligence system that:
1. Ingests and analyzes diverse financial data sources (SEC filings, earnings calls, news)
2. Identifies significant market events and generates expert-level analysis
3. Demonstrates production-grade ML/NLP skills using modern frameworks

The final system produces structured analytical outputs with mechanism explanations, historical precedents, confidence ratings, and counterarguments - delivering insights comparable to professional financial analysts.

## **2. Data Pipeline Architecture**

### **2.1 Multi-Source Data Ingestion**
- **Primary Financial Sources**:
  - SEC EDGAR API: Quarterly/annual reports (10-Q/K), 8-K material events
  - Earnings call transcripts: Via Alpha Vantage API or web scraping
  - FOMC statements and economic releases

- **News & Media Sources** (Tier 2):
  - Financial news APIs: Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC via RSS/API
  - Industry publications: WSJ, Financial Times, Barron's
  - Alternative data: Reddit r/investing, r/wallstreetbets (sentiment signals)

- **Storage & Versioning**:
  - Raw data → DVC (Data Version Control)
  - Processed events → Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate)
  - Change tracking via GitHub Actions

### **2.2 Data Processing Pipeline**
```python
# Example pipeline code (include in documentation)
class FinancialDataPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.edgar_client = EdgarClient(config.edgar_api_key)
        self.news_scraper = NewsScraperFactory.create(config.news_sources)
        self.preprocessor = TextPreprocessor(config.preprocessing_steps)
        
    def run_daily_pipeline(self):
        # Fetch new data
        sec_filings = self.edgar_client.get_latest_filings()
        news_articles = self.news_scraper.get_daily_articles()
        
        # Preprocess
        processed_data = self.preprocessor.process_batch(sec_filings + news_articles)
        
        # Store
        self.database.upsert_documents(processed_data)
        
        return processed_data
```

## **3. Core ML Components**

### **3.1 Event Detection & Classification**
- **Model**: Fine-tuned Roberta-large with financial domain adaptation
- **Classification Task**: Multi-label classification of 15+ event types:
  - Economic: `RATE_HIKE`, `INFLATION_SURPRISE`
  - Corporate: `EARNINGS_MISS`, `CEO_CHANGE`, `MERGER_ANNOUNCEMENT`
  - Geopolitical: `TARIFF_IMPOSITION`, `SUPPLY_CHAIN_DISRUPTION`

- **Training Approach**:
  - Base dataset: FinancialPhrase-Bank + SEC-BERT corpus
  - Augmentation: Synthetic examples via few-shot prompting
  - Evaluation: 5-fold cross-validation, F1-score > 0.85 target

### **3.2 Advanced RAG System**
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB (self-hosted) with hybrid search
- **Knowledge Base Content**:
  - Historical market events (2000-present)
  - Past analyst reports (public summaries)
  - Financial theory excerpts
  - Economic indicators dataset

- **Retrieval Strategy**:
  ```python
  # Example of advanced RAG implementation
  def retrieve_relevant_context(self, event_type, entity, description):
      # Semantic search
      semantic_results = self.vector_db.similarity_search(
          description, 
          filter={"event_type": event_type, "entity": entity},
          k=3
      )
      
      # Hybrid search with reranking
      if len(semantic_results) < 3:
          keyword_results = self.vector_db.keyword_search(
              f"{event_type} {entity}",
              k=2
          )
          reranker = CrossEncoderReranker("cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2")
          all_results = semantic_results + keyword_results
          reranked_results = reranker.rerank(description, all_results)
          return reranked_results[:3]
      
      return semantic_results
  ```

### **3.3 Analysis Generation System**
- **Base Model**: Llama-3-8B (quantized to 4-bit for efficiency)
- **Fine-tuning Approach**:
  - Dataset: 300 hand-crafted examples + 2,000 synthetic examples
  - Training: LoRA adaptation (rank=16, alpha=32)
  - Evaluation: ROUGE-L, BERTScore against gold standard analysis

- **Inference Pipeline**:
  1. Detect event from input source
  2. Retrieve relevant historical precedents
  3. Generate structured analysis with 4 components:
     - Mechanism explanation
     - Historical precedents
     - Confidence assessment (High/Medium/Low + rationale)
     - Counterarguments

- **Output Schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "event_id": "2023-06-15-FED-RATE-HIKE",
    "event_type": "RATE_HIKE",
    "entities": ["Federal Reserve", "US Economy"],
    "analysis": {
      "mechanism": "Fed rate hikes increase borrowing costs, potentially slowing economic growth and pressuring equity valuations, particularly for growth stocks.",
      "historical_precedents": [
        {"period": "2018", "description": "Powell's rate hikes → S&P dropped 20%"},
        {"period": "2004-2006", "description": "Gradual rate increases → minimal impact"}
      ],
      "confidence": {
        "level": "Medium",
        "rationale": "Market largely priced in hike, but recession fears linger"
      },
      "counterarguments": "Inflation could moderate faster than expected, allowing Fed to pivot sooner; strong labor market may cushion economic impact."
    }
  }
  ```

## **7. Example Output**

```
Event: China Announces New Tariffs on US Imports (2023-09-15)

Analysis:

Mechanism: Tariffs raise input costs, squeezing margins for import-reliant sectors (autos, retail). US companies with Chinese manufacturing face disrupted supply chains and potential demand loss in Chinese markets.

Historical Precedents:
- 2018 Trump tariffs → S&P dropped 6% in 2 weeks.
- 2002 Bush steel tariffs → industrials fell 15%.

Confidence: Medium (tariffs often overblown, but macro is fragile).

Counterarguments: Fed might cut rates to offset impact, China could delay retaliation to prevent further economic slowdown, or companies may absorb costs rather than pass to consumers.
```
